# bash-gallery-http-server  
## Purpose   
In nodejs, you can call http-server in any folder and your node can service this data of current as in the web.  
But some time we want to have a gallery-http-server to just show gallery on the web but not documents like http-server.  
So we can make some thing like   gallery-http-server.sh [port_number] to show photos in a ncie gallery view.  
$ cd some_photos    
$ gallery-http-server.sh 3344    
  
Then browser can open http://[you_host]:3344 to see the gallery of the photos in ./some_photos
